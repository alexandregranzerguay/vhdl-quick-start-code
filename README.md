# VHDL Quick-Start Templates!
Templates for most common VHDL components, ex: state machines, basic components, test benchs, etc. Quickly get started while following a style guide recommend by Xilinx

## Templates:
### State Machine
Templates can be used for both Moore or Mealy finite state machines (FSMs).
> Finite State Machines (FSM) are sequential circuit used in many digital systems to control the behavior of
> systems and dataflow paths. Examples of FSM include control units and sequencers. -Xilinx
